Normally Product Managers are seen as the \"Force\n        Multiplier\" for the business, but I feel like working with Kai has been\n        the opposite. Kai doesn't shy away from a meeting or conversation with\n        anyone, and always asks great clarifying questions. They will even go so\n        far as to scope out tickets for me and lead the team through heavy\n        technical discussions, and have saved me so much time and allowed me to\n        focus efforts elsewhere that I have had to put off. To me, this serves\n        as a great example of a leader, as they are working to help people\n        outside the confines of those they collaborate with on a daily basis.\n        Kai also maintains an EXTREMELY positive attitude about seemingly\n        everything. When things are shit, and everyone is stressed, Kai always\n        finds a way to keep themselves positive, and focused on the things that\n        are going well. I feel that this kind of attitude becomes contagious,\n        and it forces people to do the same, and I even find myself feeling a\n        little more positive knowing I have Kai on my side coming into work, and\n        things won't be so bad as a result. Lastly, Kai feels like a good\n        person, more than just a co-worker. I never feel anxiety or any negative\n        emotions whenever I get a DM from Kai, and I'm always excited to answer\n        because I know Kai is either going to have an insightful\n        thought/question/idea about work, or be willing to joke around to\n        lighten the mood, and banter a bit back and forth, but never crosses any\n        boundaries or lines.\"\n      </p>\n      <div style={{ alignSelf: \"flex-end\", paddingBottom: 15 }}>\n        <i>Ian Griesdorn - Product Manager, Own Up</i>\n      </div>\n      <p>\n        \"Kai is a supremely motivated individual with whom I've had the pleasure\n        of working ever since they were hired out of a programming bootcamp way\n        back in the summer of 2019. Kai levels up their knowledge quickly,\n        leaving no stone unturned. This has served them very well as tech lead:\n        the thoroughness and detail with which they prepare documentation and\n        break down the work into tasks, and the manner in which they comport\n        themselves when disseminating the information to other engineers. This\n        instills a lot of confidence in the team because they understand the\n        work, and they know that Kai's got their back. More generally, Kai is an\n        absolute rock for the team. They're very reliable and responsive, and do\n        a wonderful job of balancing delivery of story items against their\n        other, higher level obligations. They're good about asking for help when\n        they need it; and they're happy to pair with others to unblock them. I\n        want to call out Kai's attentiveness towards matters of inclusivity.\n        While we were porting the main marketing site from Wordpress, Kai\n        identified tooling to test for and familiarized themselves with\n        standards for accessibility, and helped make them part of the best\n        practices and CI/CD for our most public-facing frontends. During our\n        hackathon week, they successfully implemented customer-facing tooling to\n        collect user pronouns to promote social inclusion. I admire Kai for\n        their incredible thoughtfulness, and their willingness and ability to\n        meet others where they are.\"\n      </p>\n      <div style={{ alignSelf: \"flex-end\", paddingBottom: 15 }}>\n        <i>Liz Lorenz - Engineering Manager, Own Up</i>\n      </div>\n      <p>\n        \"Kai is an absolute shining star on the development team.
