        "K is the epitome of a team player. They have an ease of personality
        that allows them to get along with everyone, paired with an honest moral
        compass; they are a team member who is looking out for the good of
        everyone in the organization, and working to ensure that workplaces are
        a safe and inclusive atmosphere for all. K leads by inspiring others to
        be the best they can be and helping them to reach their goals, while
        working hard to better themselves along the way. If you have a problem,
        K will have a myriad of creative and thoughtful solutions. It was an
        honor and a pleasure to work with K, and I can say with absolute
        confidence that any organization would surely benefit from their
        positive presence, skills, and commitment."

        "Working with K is so wonderful because they bring so many things to an
        organization's mission and to a team: passion, commitment, a
        collaborative spirit, creativity, innovation, intelligence,
        perseverance, kindness, compassion. I have learned so much working with
        K - most outstanding is what it means to jump into something you don't
        know, and to figure out how to achieve it. Anything that is given to K,
        they tackle. They are someone I can depend on, someone I can trust. K is
        also so fun to work with. All of this together makes K an amazing person
        to have on your team."

        "In my 10+ years of working at Addgene, K was easily one of the
        sharpest, hardest working employees with whom I've worked. Most
        employees are either "big picture" people or "detail oriented", but K
        could transition between both states with apparent ease. Whether they
        were managing a project, process, or a team of people, their ability to
        identify pain points and create viable solutions to those pain points
        was enviable. I would hire them again in a second."
