        "Since working with Kai, I feel like I have been empowered to an even
        greater degree. Normally Product Managers are seen as the "Force
        Multiplier" for the business, but I feel like working with Kai has been
        the opposite. Kai doesn't shy away from a meeting or conversation with
        anyone, and always asks great clarifying questions. They will even go so
        far as to scope out tickets for me and lead the team through heavy
        technical discussions, and have saved me so much time and allowed me to
        focus efforts elsewhere that I have had to put off. To me, this serves
        as a great example of a leader, as they are working to help people
        outside the confines of those they collaborate with on a daily basis.
        Kai also maintains an EXTREMELY positive attitude about seemingly
        everything. When things are shit, and everyone is stressed, Kai always
        finds a way to keep themselves positive, and focused on the things that
        are going well. I feel that this kind of attitude becomes contagious,
        and it forces people to do the same, and I even find myself feeling a
        little more positive knowing I have Kai on my side coming into work, and
        things won't be so bad as a result. Lastly, Kai feels like a good
        person, more than just a co-worker. I never feel anxiety or any negative
        emotions whenever I get a DM from Kai, and I'm always excited to answer
        because I know Kai is either going to have an insightful
        thought/question/idea about work, or be willing to joke around to
        lighten the mood, and banter a bit back and forth, but never crosses any
        boundaries or lines."

        "Kai is a supremely motivated individual with whom I've had the pleasure
        of working ever since they were hired out of a programming bootcamp way
        back in the summer of 2019. Kai levels up their knowledge quickly,
        leaving no stone unturned. This has served them very well as tech lead:
        the thoroughness and detail with which they prepare documentation and
        break down the work into tasks, and the manner in which they comport
        themselves when disseminating the information to other engineers. This
        instills a lot of confidence in the team because they understand the
        work, and they know that Kai's got their back. More generally, Kai is an
        absolute rock for the team. They're very reliable and responsive, and do
        a wonderful job of balancing delivery of story items against their
        other, higher level obligations. They're good about asking for help when
        they need it; and they're happy to pair with others to unblock them. I
        want to call out Kai's attentiveness towards matters of inclusivity.
        While we were porting the main marketing site from Wordpress, Kai
        identified tooling to test for and familiarized themselves with
        standards for accessibility, and helped make them part of the best
        practices and CI/CD for our most public-facing frontends. During our
        hackathon week, they successfully implemented customer-facing tooling to
        collect user pronouns to promote social inclusion. I admire Kai for
        their incredible thoughtfulness, and their willingness and ability to
        meet others where they are."

        "Kai is an absolute shining star on the development team. I have never
        met someone with so much passion and initiative to take on such in-depth
        research in order to identify solutions for problems raised to them,
        even outside of their own responsibilities! Their advocacy for the
        partnership between design and development has been critical to the
        success of the design system, and I could not have done it without
        them!"

        "Kai is the epitome of a team player. They have an ease of personality
        that allows them to get along with everyone, paired with an honest moral
        compass; they are a team member who is looking out for the good of
        everyone in the organization, and working to ensure that workplaces are
        a safe and inclusive atmosphere for all. Kai leads by inspiring others
        to be the best they can be and helping them to reach their goals, while
        working hard to better themselves along the way. If you have a problem,
        Kai will have a myriad of creative and thoughtful solutions. It was an
        honor and a pleasure to work with Kai, and I can say with absolute
        confidence that any organization would surely benefit from their
        positive presence, skills, and commitment."

        "Working with Kai is so wonderful because they bring so many things to
        an organization's mission and to a team: passion, commitment, a
        collaborative spirit, creativity, innovation, intelligence,
        perseverance, kindness, compassion. I have learned so much working with
        Kai - most outstanding is what it means to jump into something you don't
        know, and to figure out how to achieve it. Anything that is given to
        Kai, they tackle. They are someone I can depend on, someone I can trust.
        Kai is also so fun to work with. All of this together makes Kai an
        amazing person to have on your team."

        "In my 10+ years of working at Addgene, Kai was easily one of the
        sharpest, hardest working employees with whom I've worked. Most
        employees are either "big picture" people or "detail oriented", but Kai
        could transition between both states with apparent ease. Whether they
        were managing a project, process, or a team of people, their ability to
        identify pain points and create viable solutions to those pain points
        was enviable. I would hire them again in a second."
